# Introduction

The replacement of the Gravettian technocomplex by the Solutrean, impacted by adverse climatic conditions during the Heinrich event 2 (HE2), continues to be an essential topic to understand the Upper Paleolithic evolution and human adaptations to climatic changes at the end of the Pleistocene. The Proto-Solutrean is, in this topic, an essential piece to understand how hunter-gatherer communities adapted, reinvented and abandoned their social and technological organization, leading to the development of the Solutrean innovations. However, most of what is known for this technocomplex is still geographically constricted and lacking good chronological markers [@cascalheiraandbicho2013], which hampers the understanding of the Proto-Solutrean solutions and their role in the Gravettian-Solutrean transition.

By understanding the need to better comprehend the Proto-Solutrean and how abrupt climate change impacted these communities, this study's primary goal was to answer provide additional details to answer the question: what impact did the HE 2 have on the technological organization of human communities, at the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), in southwestern Iberia? To do so, an analysis of stone tool assemblages coming from levels attributed to the Gravettian-Solutrean transition timeframe, from two recently excavated sites - Vale Boi (southern Portugal) and Lapa do Picareiro (central Portugal) - was performed.

To answer this question, the following goals were set:

* Understand the technological organization of Layers 5/4E of Vale Boi, and U/T from Lapa do Picareiro, by characterizing their technological patterns, reduction sequences and raw material use/preference patterns.

* Identify possible Terminal Gravettian horizons or facies within the Proto-Solutrean occupations in Vale Boi and Lapa do Picareiro and their respective chronologies.

* Test the Gravettian-Solutrean transition models (Two-phase and Three-phase), previously developed using data from the Portuguese Estremadura [@zilhao1997], to understand which model best explains the transition, but also if those patterns can be applied to other geographic areas outside of the Estremadura.

By accomplishing these goals, through the use of new data resulting from recent excavations, with good chronological resolution and from a wider geographical range, this thesis contributes to a better understanding of the Proto-Solutrean and the Gravettian-Solutrean transition in western Iberia.

The presentation of the results is organized into 7 chapters. Chapter 2, following this introduction, discusses the impact of climate changes on cultural organization, especially during the HE 2, describes the paleoclimate dynamics during this event and presents the state-of-the-art for the Gravettian-Solutrean transition in Portugal, focusing mostly the technological characteristics of lithic materials.

Chapter 3 introduces the archaeological sites used in the study, with a brief description of their location and geological context, followed by an overview of the history of the archaeological works, excavation methodology, and the characteristics of human occupation across the different areas, particularly focusing on the levels associated with onset of the the LGM.

Chapter 4 presents a detailed explanation of the methods employed during the recording of lithic attributes and statistical analysis of data.

Chapter 5 consists of the description of the results obtained through the analysis of the assemblages from Vale Boi and Lapa do Picareiro, respectively. This chapter is organized into two different parts. The first part describes the general characteristics of the assemblages, organizing them by site. The second part focus on the description of raw material exploitation patterns, also for each context independently. And the final part presents the results of the techno-typological analysis, being organized by technological classes (cores, core maintenance products, flakes, elongated blanks and retouched tools), with a final section dedicated to the description of the Vale Comprido component of the assemblages.

Chapter 6 focuses the discussion of the results presented in the previous chapter, comparing them to the current knowledge on the Proto-Solutrean, mostly coming from sites located in the Portuguese Estremadura. This discussion is made through the exploration of specific topics which relate to the overarching goals of the study, providing specific insights on the intra and inter-assemblage variability and their dynamics across time.

The final chapter consist of this studyâ€™s conclusions, systematizing the interpretations and overall contributions of the presented results.
