The present thesis aims to answer the following question: what impact did the Heinrich 2 event have on the technological organization of human communities, on the onset of the last glacial maximum, in south western Iberia? This question follows the understanding that climatic events such as the HE2 seem to correlate to cultural changes, although the existing models do not consider the Proto-Solutrean technocomplex as an individual phase for the Gravettian-Solutrean transition, thus leaving a gap in the current knowledge of the Upper Paleolithic. \par

To approach this problematic we analysed the lithic assemblages from Vale Boi (south Portugal) and Lapa do Picareiro (central Portugal) to understand the technological patterns and territory exploitation during the Proto-Solutrean, with the following goals: 1) understand and explain specific site technological and raw material use patterns; 2) establish parallels between the two sites; 3) compare these results with those obtained for other Proto-Solutrean sites, mostly from the Portuguese Estremadura.

The analysis followed a technologic and morphologic attribute approach, with the statistical treatment of data through descriptive and multivariate analysis, the latter through the use of a technological domain approach to reduce assemblage variability.
