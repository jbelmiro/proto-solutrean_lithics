The present study aims to answer the question: what impact did the Heinrich event 2 have on the technological organization of human communities, at the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, in south western Iberia? The impact of this event on the Gravettian-Solutrean transition has been previously suggested [@bradtmoller2012]. However, the existing models do not consider the Proto-Solutrean technocomplex as an individual phase for this transition [@cascalheiraandbicho2013]. \par

To address this question, this study analysed the lithic assemblages from Layers 5 and 4E of the site of Vale Boi (southern Portugal) and Levels U and T from Lapa do Picareiro (central Portugal). We aimed to understand the technological patterns and raw material exploitation during the Proto-Solutrean, and test the existing models with assemblages from recently excavated sites, while expanding the geographic range.

The analysis followed a technological attributes approach. The retrieved data was fully analysed in R environment.

Results show the existence of two discrete phases in each site. The first, with high frequency of quartz use for bladelet production, seems to reflect the presence, in both sites, of a Terminal Gravettian horizon, as defined by Almeida (2000). The second, with some significant differences between sites, attests the presence of Vale Comprido technology and lower quartz frequencies at Vale Boi, representing a Proto-Solutrean occupation; and the presence of a blade component in Lapa do Picareiro that, together with the respective absolute chronology, may attributed to a Proto-Solutrean or an Early Solutrean horizon.

In general terms, this study allowed to confirm that the Terminal Gravettian and the Proto-Solutrean are discrete phases across the transiton, in concordance with the Three-Phase model presented by Zilh√£o [-@zilhao1997]. It further consolidates the expansion of similar techno-cultural patterns to southern Portugal, that may be explained by the expansion of social networks [@cascalheiraandbicho2013]. Associated with the dominance of different technological patterns and intensive use of quartz, we may understand these horizons as a moment of cultural reorganization, onset by environmental pressures.
