## Assemblages

### Vale Boi
As mentioned in previous chapters, the lithic assemblages analyzed in this study come from layers 4E and 5 of the Terrace area. The present study only considered materials from rows H, I and J, excavated between 2012 and 2019.

Artifact distribution across Layers 5 and 4E confirms an interesting pattern already evidenced in previous works (e.g., Belmiro 2018). As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:spatialdistribution), the distribution of artifacts (excluding chips), clearly shows a concentration of materials in the top of the sequence, corresponding to the totality of Layer 4E and the first c. 10 cm of Layer 5. The discard rates of artifacts then gradually diminishes in the middle and bottom sections of Level 5.

A preliminary visual analysis to the artifact distribution presented in Figure \@ref(fig:spatialdistribution) does not seem to show concentrations of specific raw materials along the stratigraphy. 


```{r spatialdistributionVB, fig.cap="Spatial distribution of lithic artefacts (without chips) by raw material, on unit H.", echo=FALSE}

# Setup filters for graph
spatial <- dataset %>% 
  filter(Code != "Bucket") %>% 
  filter(Class != "Chip") %>% 
  filter(Unit%in%c("H18","H19","H20","H21")) %>% 
  filter(Y > 1) %>% 
  filter(Z < 25) %>% 
  filter(Z > 1) 

# Plot graph
spatial %>%   
mutate(RawMaterial = factor(RawMaterial, levels = c("Quartz", # order y axis
                                                      "Chert", "Greywacke", "Chalcedony",
                                                      "Dolerite", "Other"))) %>%

  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10, vjust = -1)) + 
  scale_color_jco() 

```

However, when calculating the percentages of the three most important raw materials by cubic meter of excavated sediment (Figure \@ref(fig:rmdispersion)) and plotting them by depth, there are significant differences in raw material distribution over time. From around 24.1 m of depth upwards, there is an important shift in quartz and chert frequencies, the latter increasing more than 10%, and quartz dropping from c. 50% to nearly 30%. Greywacke frequencies follow those of quartz.

This shift seems to be associated with other significant changes in the Terrace sequence, such as the abovementioned increase in the amount of lithic materials in top Layer 5 and Layer 4e, but also the appearance of Vale Comprido technology. Additionally, these two moments are stratigraphically correlated with two different chronological horizons, the first, dated to c. 26 kcal BP, at c. 23.9 m depth, and associated with higher frequencies of quartz, and the second, dated to c. 24.7 kcal BP, at around 24.1 m depth, associated with higher frequencies of chert and a reduction in quartz presence.

As such, and given the chronological, density of artifacts, and raw material preference patterns, it was decided that for this study the materials would be subdivided in two analytical units, to better understand any possible technological differences: *Lower 5*, including all artifacts with Z values under 24.1; *Upper 5/4E*, including all artifacts with Z values of 24.1 and above. The value 24.1 is arbitrary and was chosen for the reasons mentioned before: it seems to be where the separation between higher and lower densities of lithic materials occurs and, also, where the inversion of quartz and chert frequencies happens.

A total of 26711 pieces were analyzed for both groups, 11094 from Lower 5 group and 15609 for the Upper 5/4E. Most of these are chips (70.62% from Lower 5 and 65.8% from Upper 5/4E), followed by shatters, which make up c. 21% and c. 24% of the groups, respectively. These extremely high numbers for debris are mostly the result of quartz use, which can be explained not only by on-site knapping of this raw material but mostly by its breakage patterns (especially when coarser), which typically produces more waste than in other raw materials.

For Lower 5, cores and debitage products represent a cumulative frequency of c. 8%. For Upper 5/4E, debitage products represent nearly 10% of the group's assemblage. Complete blanks are the most represented class for both groups, with 1476 identified pieces, 4.5% for Lower 5 and 6.18% for Upper 5/4E, followed by blank fragments, with an absolute count of 248 for Lower 5 and 336 for Upper 5/4E. Cores are also relatively frequent within these assemblages, with an absolute count of 123 cores, 46 for Lower 5 and 77 for Upper 5/4E, while core fragments appear in much smaller numbers (n=11 and n=16, respectively).

During the analysis, 167 retouched pieces were identified, 55 on Lower 5, representing 0.5% of the group, and 112 on Upper 5/4E, with a frequency of 0.72%. Retouched piece fragments composed a much smaller number (n = 7 for Lower 5 and n = 16 for Upper 5/4E).

### Lapa do Picareiro
The materials from Lapa do Picareiro selected for this study come exclusively from Levels U and T. Based on chronological data and artifact distribution along the sequence, these levels had been previously organized into two distinct cultural horizons (Haws et al. 2019), somehow similar to the Terminal Gravettian and Proto-Solutrean phases in the traditional transition model (ZilhÃ£o et al.  1999). 

Given this geo-archaeological background, for the present analysis the materials were separated into two assembllages: U/Lower T, which included all artifacts with depths inferior to 566.9 m or (in case of artifacts lacking 3D coordinates) from all spits from Level U and spits 6 through 8 from Level T (Haws et al. 2019); Middle T, including all artifacts with depths equal or superior to 566.9 m, or from the top five spits of Level T. Any other artifact in the assemblage which did not have a depth value or Level/Spit was not considered in these results since it lacked the needed information to contextualize its technological attributes. Also excluded from this study are the materials found on top of Level T undoubtedly attributed to the solutrean (Haws et al. 2019, Bennedeti et al. 2018). 

A total of 376 pieces were analyzed, 196 coming from the U/Lower T phase and 180 from the Middle T group. In both phases, debitage waste is mostly composed of chips, which represents 49.4% of the U/Lower T group and 37.2% of the Middle T group. As in Vale Boi, these values for chippage can be mostly explained by quartz breakage patterns.

The second most present class for both assemblages are complete blanks, which represent 14.2% of the U/Lower T group and 37.2% of the Middle T group, followed by blank fragments (13.7% and 15.5%, respectively). Retouched pieces have relatively small frequencies, representing c. 3% in both U/Lower T and Middle T. Cores are very scarce in both groups, 1% in the U/Lower T group (n=2) and c. 3% in the Middle T (n=5).

## Raw materials
Raw material use and availability, specifically abundance and quality, stand as important factors for understanding the organization of technology, as it may affect decisions regarding tool design and conservation of such tools [@andrefsky1994], as well as mobility and niche expansion [@cascalheira2013]. This quality is connected to both the raw materialâs fracture mechanics and their intrinsic mineral characteristics, such as the size of their grain, homogeneity [@andrefsky1994], or even hardness [@kempson2011], which allow the knapper predictability over the outcome (Andresfsky 2005).

There are a number of stones that are constant throughout the stone age archaeological record for having the necessary properties described above. Stones or minerals characterized by high frequencies of silica, such as chert or quartz, allow for good fracture predictability, while other materials with less homogeneity may progressively result in less predictable characteristics (Andresfsky 2005). Thus, despite the raw material variability within the pre-historic archaeological record, linked to its availability and geomorphological contexts of the sites, the selection is often coherent regarding fracture mechanics, where predictable conchoidal fractures are preferred [@inizan1999; @tixier1980] (Andrefsky 2005).

This pattern is also observable at Vale Boi and Lapa do Picareiro as showned below. Previous studies have shown that throughout most levels of human occupation at both sites, chert, fine quartz and greywacke (in the case of Vale Boi) or Quartzite (in the case of Lapa do Picareiro) (all three characterized by conchoidal fracture, although greywacke is often coarse and more unpredictable) were the most frequently used [@bichoetal2012; @cascalheira2010; @marreiros2009] (Pereira et al. 2016, Haws et al. 2019, Beneddeti et al. 2018). While at Vale Boi all the materials are available at a regional and local scale, at Lapa do Picareiro a more detailed analysis is needed to assess raw material provenance. Also, although the presence of the main raw materials is documented across all archaeological levels in Vale Boi, with each occupation differing in the frequency of their use,   chert is always the primary material used for knapping [@cascalheira2010]. At Lapa do Picareiro, the use of chert is not always a preference, such as in the case of Level FF, where quartzite is clearly dominant. The characteristics of Lapa do Picareiro and the potential functional specificities of each occupation must have had a significant impact on the type and quality of the discard materials.

For the present study, criteria used for raw material analysis focused on the identification of broader groups of stones and minerals, based on their general observable characteristics, without focusing on particular features within each raw material. Two exceptions were made, however. At both sites, quartz was subdivided into different categories regarding the size of the grain, to isolate and better understand the different uses of quartz over time. At Lapa do Picareiro, chert was organized based on color to evaluate the integrity of the deposits and, preliminarly, explore the spatial organization of levels U and T. Both of these exceptions are presented in the following sections where the patterns of exploitation of the more relevant raw materials are discussed for each site.


### Vale Boi
One of the most relevant raw materials in both of Vale Boi analytical units used for this study is quartz (encompassing rock crystal, fine, medium and coarse qualities), which represents c. 43% of the total assemblage for the Upper 5/4E group, and c. 51% for Lower 5. Chert, on the other hand, represents c. 46% of the Upper 5/4E phase and 38% of the Lower 5. Finally,  greywacke, dolerite, chalcedony, and other raw materials that due to their low frequencies were collapsed in the category âOtherâ, together represent c. 11% of both assemblages (Figure \@ref(fig:rmvb)).

```


#### Quartz
The number of chips and shatter in quartz are, as seen in Table XXX, extremely high, both in its representativity within the raw material, with c. 94% for both Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E, and when compared to the relative frequencies of other raw materials.

Despite the low frequencies presented on the table, there is a large number of quartz blanks (n=281 for Lower 5 and n=438 for Upper 5/4E) compared to the rest of the classes, as well as cores (n=18 for Lower 5 and n=32 for Upper 5/4E) and retouched pieces (n=15 for Lower 5 and n=34 for Upper 5/4E).
Most of the quartz artifacts do not show the presence of cortex, with nearly 95% of all artifacts having 0% cortex. When cortex is present, around 72% of the artifacts indicate the exploitation of cobbles or pebbles. These patterns are similar for both Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E (Figure \@ref(fig:quartzqualityVB)).

As mentioned before, quartz was organized into groups regarding grain size. Analyzing the artifact class frequency through the different identified types of quartz confirmed an already expected pattern: the production of blanks was largely accomplished using fine and medium quality quartz (52.1% and 32.7% for Lower 5, and 49.3% and 32.1% for Upper 5/4E, respectively). Most of the retouched tools were also recorded for these two types of quartz quality (66.7% and 26.7% for Lower 5, and 55.9% and 44.1% for Upper 5/4E). No retouched pieces were identified in coarse quartz and rock crystal. The latter type represents, also, a rather small fraction of the assemblage. In accordance with previous studies on Vale Boi lithic industries (e.g. Cascalheira 2009, Marreiros 2009) coarse quartz appears mostly as knapping shatters, or as other type of fragments not related to human knapping (see Manne et al. 2012 for more information).

```

#### Chert
Chert shows high frequencies of blanks (15.8% for Lower 5 and 19.5% for Upper 5/4E) when compared to every other class, excluding chips (Table XXX). The latter represents more than 50% of the chert assemblages, with an absolute frequency of 649 chips for Lower 5 and 1158 for Upper 5/4E.

Although chert shows smaller absolute numbers for blanks (n=171 for Lower 5 and n=407 for Upper 5/4E) and blank fragments (n=90 for Lower 5 and n=155 for Upper 5/4E) compared to quartz, there is a large quantity of cores representing 2.1% of total chert in Lower 5 and 2% in Upper 5/4E. However, Table XXX shows a noticeable difference in the ratio between chert blanks and quartz blanks in Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E, with the latter showing a higher frequency of chert blanks compared to Upper 5/4E.

Regarding retouched pieces, these represent more than 3% of chert for both phases, a number far higher than those in other raw materials, thus showing that chert, although less present than quartz in blanks (although barely in Upper 5/4E), might have been preferentially used for formal tool production.

Chert also shows the most prominent variability of cortex frequencies in both phases (Figure \@(fig:rmcortex)), although there is a clear dominance of artifacts with 0% cortex, a pattern that was already expected, following the process of the knapping sequence, where only the first blanks removed from an unmodified block will be entirely cortical, showing increasingly less cortex for posterior removals (Andrefsky 2005). It is noteworthy, however, that for both phases, a significant number of chert artifacts (c. 25%) presented cortical surfaces, confirming that chert nodules were imported to the site and thus all phases of the reduction sequences are likely represented.

This variability in cortex presence is accompanied by some diversity of cortex types, with the presence of both cobble and outcrop sources, even though for almost 85% of the artifacts it was not possible to identify a specific type of cortex (Table \@ref(tab:cortextab1)).


#### Greywacke
Greywacke is a variety of sandstone, often characterized by its hardness, dark color and poorly sorted grains of quartz and feldspar (Haldar and Tisljar 2014). At Vale Boi, this raw material is highly heterogeneous, showing a wide variety of grain sizes and colors.

Within the studied assemblage, greywacke is best represented by debitage waste, with nearly 25% of shatter and around 70% of chips, for both Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E. In contrast, relatively low numbers for blanks (n=44 for Lower 5 and n=80 for Upper 5/4E) and cores (n=3 for Lower 5 and 1 for Upper 5/4E) were recorded. The same applies to the retouched tools category, with three artifacts recorded, one of which is a Vale Comprido piece, in the Upper 5/4E phase.

When chips and shatters are removed, greywacke has a representation of less than 10% in both assemblages making it the third most used raw material.

Similarly to the other raw materials, there is, for both phases, the predominance of debitage without cortex (Figure \@ref(fig:rmcortex)). There is, however, some variability in cortex presence, even if in smaller frequencies than the patterns observed for chert. As in the case of quartz, most of the identified cortex presented water-worned surfaces, indicating the exploitation of cobbles or, most likely, slabs.


#### Dolerite
Dolerite is a volcanic igneous rock, occurring mostly in dikes, varying between coarse and fine textures, and often having a dark, grey or greyish-green coloration (Haldar and Tisljar 2014; Wadley and Kempson 2011; Belmiro 2018). In the Algarve, its presence is registered in two main areas : , and near Sagres, southwest of the Algarve, as outcrops within the Messejana fault (Belmiro 2018).

At Vale Boi, this raw material was first identified as jasper when excavating the levels referring to the Proto-Solutrean occupation in the terrace area (units J-L), before 2012 (Marreiros 2009). The material has a very characteristic reddish-brown color and fine texture, with a conchoidal fracture. Despite this coloration, which is also present in jasper, a red-colored variety of chalcedony, the raw material was later identified as dolerite, and its coloration explained by the presence of a reddish patina which would have altered the original rock by processes of iron mineral oxidation through contact with the terra rossa (Belmiro 2018).

The analysis of a thin section obtained from a dolerite fragment from the present assemblage allowed the characterization of this raw material, through its visible features and petrography.

The reddish coloration was confirmed to be an exterior patina, no more than 1 mm thick, completely covering the artifacts. The actual rock still displays a fine texture but with an opaque black color.

Results from the petrographic analysis done through the observation of the thin section using a polarizing microscope revealed the presence of several minerals, such as feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, small quantities of silica, little presence of mica and iron oxide, which are in concordance with the mineral composition of dolerite or possibly hornfels (Wadley and Kempson 2011). The feldspar minerals showed the presence of undulatory extinction, a deformation that takes place whenever certain minerals are exposed to high temperatures (Frost and Frost 2014), thus indicating that the raw material is highly metamorphized.

Regarding the differentiation between dolerite and hornfels, although these two rocks have different origins, the latter being of volcanic igneous origin, considered a contact metamorphic rock (Haldar and Tisljar 2014), they share enough physical and mineral characteristics (whenever the dolerite has a fine texture) to hinder their precise identification. Literature most often uses other methods to differentiate them, such as FTIR, XRF, by understanding not the mineral composition (which is essentially the same) but the ratio of components presence. This matter is further complexified by understanding that hornfels might originate from metamorphized igneous rocks, several sources of hornfels attributed to dolerite dikes (Wadley and Kempson 2011; Hallinan and Shaw 2017).

Given this difficulty, although the present analysis will use the term dolerite, for their reported similarities in terms of texture, grain size and fracture, further chemical studies need to be done in order to confirm whether the raw material is dolerite or possibly hornfels. Regarding the latter, there is also the presence of hornfels outcrops and rounded pebbles in the Algarve, near the southwestern coast, thus strengthening the hypothesis that this raw material, whether dolerite or hornfels, is available regionally.

Looking at the interior of dolerite allowed, during the second moment of analysis, to identify other products in the same raw material, which were not previously identified due to the lack of the same reddish patina. This patina also appears throughout the assemblage, mostly on greywacke, although without forming the same 1 mm thick layer visible on the dolerite pieces. This may be explained by the inherent mineral characteristics of this type of raw material and their reaction with the surrounding sediment.

The presence of this patina in several degrees of intensity, preferentially in dolerite and greywacke, its presence in both finished complete artifacts and flake fragments or shatters, and its occurrence also reported in the literature as a process frequently affecting raw materials like hornfels (e.g., Hallinan and Shaw 2017), suggests that it is, in fact, the result of geological and chemical processes affecting these raw materials. Its absence from other raw materials, like chert or quartz, may reflect the inherent mineral properties of these materials.

Dolerite is a rather unusual raw material in the site of Vale Boi, appearing only in layers 4E and 5 of the Terrace and Proto-Solutrean levels of the Slope area. The most striking characteristic of this raw material in the assemblages under study is the low presence of chips or shatter (n=1 each), but high frequencies of blanks (50% in Lower 5 and 60.8% in Upper 5/4E) and blank fragments (16.6% in Lower 5 and 13% in Upper 5/4E) (Table XXX). Unlike Lower 5, in Upper 5/4E dolerite is represented by five retouched tools, some of which are Vale Comprido points. This raw material seems to have been used preferentially at Vale Boi for the production of these types of points, a pattern already observed in previous works (Marreiros 2009), where three out of five Vale Comprido points were identified as dolerite (originally jasper).

The absence of cores, with only one core fragment identified in the Lower 5 group, and low quantity of debitage waste may be explained by the importation of finished pieces or blanks to the site, suggesting that, most likely, no knapping activities occurred with this raw material at the site. This interpretation is, however, truncated by this studyâs phase analysis. As the identification of the inner aspect of dolerite was only achieved at the start of the second phase, which as referred before, consisted of the analysis of all cores and debitage products with a more complete database, shatter and chips were not revisited, thus not allowing for the possible identification of possible unpatinated dolerite within those classes, which might have been mistaken for fine-grained greywacke. This caveat does not, however, seem to influence the patterns regarding blank and retouched tools frequency. 


#### Chalcedony
Chalcedony is a type of cryptocrystalline quartz, characterized by a waxy and glossy appearance, ranging from a variety of possible colors (Haldar and Tisljar 2014), although white is the only present variety in the studied assemblages. The chalcedony in levels 4E and 5 is also characterized by the frequent presence of inclusions, making this raw material poorly homogeneous.

Results indicate it may have been mainly used for the production of blanks, which represent 37.5% of chalcedony in Lower 5 and 32.1% in Upper 5/4E, with a rather small representation of retouched pieces (n=2), which include a Vale Comprido point in the Upper 5/4E group. The presence of a core in Lower 5, as well as the presence of shatter and chips (in small numbers - n<5 each for Lower 5 and n=15 each for Upper 5/4E) may indicate, contrary to the dolerite, onsite knapping of this raw material (Table XXX).

Compared to other raw materials, chalcedony has the lowest frequencies of cortex, in both phases, with almost 100% of all artifacts (except shatter and chips) having 0% cortex (Figure \@ref(fig:rmcortex)).

### Lapa do Picareiro
Comparatively to Vale Boi, Lapa do Picareiro shows less raw material variability, which might be explained by the lithological characteristics of the area, already explored in other studies that showed similar raw material presence patterns [@almeida2000; @zilhao1997], but can also be related to the location of the site in a high altitude environment with significant implications to the functional nature of the occupations (see Cascalheira and Bicho 2017). The main raw materials identified were quartz and chert (Figure \@ref(fig:rmlp)). Quartz is dominant in the U/Lower T phase, representing c. 60% of the assemblage, while chert is dominant in the Middle T phase, representing c. 59%. The sporadic occurrence of other raw materials is the result of the identification of some quartzite artifacts on both phases.

#### Quartz
The number of chips in quartz, as seen on Table XXX, is extremely high, representing nearly 60% of this raw material in both phases. Other waste products, i.e. shatters, show much smaller numbers (n=4 for U/Lower T and n=3 for Middle T). Comparatively, complete blanks are the second most present class in quartz, with a frequency of 20% (n=30) for the U/Lower T group, followed by blank fragments which represent 15.2% of that assemblage. For the Middle T group, complete blanks and blank fragments show similar frequencies, representing c. 19% each. Although in small numbers, quartz shows the highest number of cores (n=4, 2 in each group) from all raw materials, but a small number of retouched tools (n=1).

Regarding cortex, quartz shows frequencies as low as 6% for cortex presence on the U/Lower T group, 12.5% on the Middle T, being mostly composed of pieces with no cortex on their dorsal surfaces. When present, cortical surfaces are all water-worned, indicating the exploitation of cobbles/pebbles (Tables \@ref(Tab:cortextabtg) and \@ref(tab:cortextabpr)).

As in Vale Boi, quartz was categorized regarding grain quality and color (Tables \@ref(tab:quartzqualityTG and \@ref(tab:quartzqualityPR). For both the U/Lower T group and Middle T, it is possible to observe a majority of fine quality quartz and rock crystal for both cores and blanks, with barely any presence of medium and coarse quality quartz. The latter category is completely absent in the Middle T group. One observable difference between the two groups is in the percentages of rock crystal and fine quality: in the U/Lower T, fine quality quartz represents c. 56% of quartz, while rock crystal has a frequency of nearly 41%; for Middle T, these percentages change, as fine quality quartz represents c. 38%, against c. 57% of rock crystal. Finally, the single identified retouched tool in U/Lower T was made in fine quality quartz.

#### Chert
Chert is characterized by a high frequency of complete blanks (c. 53% for U/Lower T and c. 63% for Middle T), with frequencies of c. 24% and c. 15% for chips and shatters in the U/Lower T and Middle T phases, respectively (Table XXX). Blank fragments are poorly represented comparatively to quartz, with an absolute count of four elements for U/Lower T and nine for the Middle T phase, representing c. 9% and c. 12% of the whole chert assemblage. Although there are few cores (n=2), retouched pieces have a relatively high frequency within chert (c. 11% on U/Lower T and c. 7% on Middle T) but also across all materials, suggesting that chert was preferentially used for the manufacture of formal tools.

Regarding cortex, chert shows mostly non-cortical pieces, particularly in the Middle T group where only 0% or 1-30% cortex frequencies were detected (Figure \@ref(fig:cortexlp)). The low frequencies of cortex resulted in a low rate of identification of cortex types across the assemblage. In fact, only two pieces for U/Lower T phase allowed to track its provenience to an outcrop source (Tables \@ref(tab:cortextabtg) and \@ref(tab:cortextabpr)).

Although chert was not initially subdivided regarding its visible characteristics, throughout the analysis, it became apparent that there were several groups with identical colors and grains, which might have belong to the same nodule. As such, these groups were posteriorly individualized, adding a variable to the database called âChertTypeâ which included codes for each identified type of chert, whose description is presented in Table \@ref(tab:cherttable).


```{r cherttable, echo=FALSE}

## RM table

After the classification of the chert types, it was attempted to refit the pieces in each group, but due to the high level of modification/edge damage of each piece and the fragmentation of the reduction sequences, no reffits were possible. Additionally, using the spatial information of artifact distribution, each group was plotted in order to understand any spatial restriction or relationship that could help to identify specific clusters throughout the stratigraphy (Figure \@ref(fig:chertspatial)).

Most groups seem to show no particular spatial constraint or pattern when plotted. The exception are RM1 and RM6 that seem to have a significant concentration of materials, both around the 567 m of depth, which corresponds to the second spit of what is considered the Middle T phase, matching also with the highest quantity of chert in the whole stratigraphic sequence, and potentially indicating the isolation of that section of the sequence as a particularly undisturbed occupation episode. Further analyses will be, however, needed to better understand the meaning of clusters like these inside the cave.

## Technological analysis

### Cores

#### Vale Boi

The core assemblage from Vale Boi totals 123 pieces, with 46 total pieces coming from the Lower 5 levels, and 77 from the Upper 5/4E (Table XXX).

Excluding inform cores, which were not considered here because they do not possess all the recordable attributes, there is a clear dominance of single platform cores, for most raw materials and in both phases. Chert presents the highest variability of core types. In the Lower 5 group chert unidirectional prismatic cores are more frequent, while in the Upper 5/4E chert all core types are more evenly present.

Most of the cores were used for the extraction of flakes, although blade and bladelet scars also show relatively high frequencies associated with the exploitation of unidirectional prismatic cores in Lower 5 and Upper5/4E groups, respectively (Figure \@ref(fig:coretypeVB)).

```

Most of the analyzed core platforms are plain or cortical. On Upper 5/4E there is a small frequency of faceted platforms on both quartz and chert (3% and 18.5% respectively). Platforms width and thickness means show smaller platforms for chert on both phases, while greywacke shows the highest means for platform measurements.

This pattern is similar for core size, where chert and quartz exhibit the smaller means, although chert seems to have more elongated cores on both phases, while greywacke and other raw materials present larger values. 

Regarding elongation, Figure \@ref(fig:coreboxplotVB) shows wider range and higher elongation values for chert cores in both phases. Upper 5/4E seems to have less elongated cores in both chert and quartz, but the t-test results indicate no significant difference between the sets (Chert p-value = `r ttest_elong_cores_chert$p.value`, Quartz p-value = `r ttest_elong_cores_quartz$p.value`. Other raw materials, including greywacke, show the lower values for elongation.

Core flattening (Figure \@ref(fig:coreboxplotVB)) (calculated by dividing maximum width by thickness) reveals that greywacke and other raw materials show higher values, while quartz and chert cores have similar values for both phases (Chert p-value = `r ttest_flat_cores_chert$p.value`, Quartz p-value = `r ttest_flat_cores_quartz$p.value`), with flattening median values of around 1.5, centered in between the second and third quartiles of the distribution.

#### Lapa do Picareiro
A total of seven cores were recorded for the Lapa do Picareiro assemblages, two in the U/Lower T group and five in the Middle T, of which two are in chert and two are in quartz.

Single platform, prismatic and pyramidal cores were identified in the Middle T group. These were mainly used to remove flakes (Figure \@ref(fig:coretypeLP)) and only prismatic cores showed evidence for the a production of mixed blanks. Platforms tend to be unfacetted, although a small number of cores presented dihedral platforms. The number of debitage surfaces is greater on chert cores for the Middle T group, while quartz varies between single and three faces.

Metrically, chert has smaller mean values for all core measurements when compared to other raw materials, showing, however, higher elongation ratios (Figure \@ref(fig:coreboxplotLP)). Regarding quartz cores, the differences between the U/Lower T phase and the Middle T phase are very obvious, with the first group showing more elongated cores with low flattening values. These differences may simply be the result of the rather small number of cores present in the assemblage, and consequent low intra-assemblage variability.

### Core maintenance products

Core maintenance products are very scarce in the assemblages from both sites, with a single identified piece at Lapa do Picareiro's U/Lower T phase (a chert core tablet), and a total of seven pieces for Vale Boi's assemblages, of which six artifacts come from the Upper 5/4E levels.

At Vale Boi core maintenance products are of two types, core fronts and core tablets (Table \@ref(tab:corepreptypeVB)). Most core maintenance products are on chert (n=5) with only two quartz core tablets identified, one for each phase.

No cortex was present in the dorsal surfaces of all core maintenance products. This pattern reveals that maintenance oprations were performed at advanced stages of the reduction sequence.

It is rather interesting the absence of crested pieces from both all assemblages, mostly at Vale Boi, where this type of core maintenance product has been referenced for both Solutrean and Gravettian occupations (Cascalheira 2013, Marreiros 2009).

```{r corepreptypeVB, echo=FALSE}

### Flakes

#### Vale Boi
A total of 1257 flakes were analysed from Vale Boi, 427 of those belonging to Lower 5 group, and 828 to the Upper 5/4E group (Table XXX). This increase was somehow expected according to the abovementioned general intensity of occupation and material density in the transition from one phase to the other. Although there are generally more flakes in quartz, it is obvious the difference in ratios between these two raw materials, when comparing Lower 5 to Upper 5/4E results.

```{r flakeboxplot, fig.cap="Flake elongation and flattening by phase and raw material.", echo=FALSE}
  
flakeB <- dataset %>%

          nrow = 2,
          common.legend = TRUE,
          legend = "right")
```

Morphologically, Lower 5 flakes seem to have mostly irregular shapes, with frequencies over 45% for most raw materials, followed by convergent and parallel shapes in much lower frequencies (under 15%) (Table XXX). Dolerite, unlike other raw materials, shows only convergent and parallel shapes even if with low representativity (n=3). Cross sections are mostly irregular and triangular, varying slightly in frequency regarding each raw material, with straight and curved profiles, these two types of profiles representing each more than 40% of chert Flakes. All raw materials, with exception of quartz, show high frequencies of straight profiles (over 40%), chert showing a similar percentage between straight and curved profiles (44.3% and 42.9% respectively). Quartz, however, has a frequency of 65% of straight profiles, showing much smaller frequencies for other types.

On Upper 5/4E, irregular shapes are still frequent, with frequencies over 25% on all raw materials, although convergent and parallel shapes show higher frequencies (over 20%) for quartz, chert and dolerite. Alike Lower 5, cross sections are mostly irregular (over 35% for most raw materials) or triangular (over 25% for all raw materials), and profile type show the same patterns and similar percentages as Lower 5.

Unidirectional scar patterns are dominant in both phases and all raw materials, with frequencies over 80%. Bidirectional patterns are slightly more relevant in chert (9.3%), and also in dolerite and chalcedony during Upper 5/4E. Dorsal patterns also show a dominance on both phases of 1, 2 and 3 scars for most raw materials, although chert shows the widest numbers and variety for higher scar counts.

Flakes have mostly plain platforms, although for certain raw materials, like quartz, there is a relevant  presence of crushed platforms (33.3% for Lower 5 and 35.9% for Upper 5/4E). Faceted platforms are present in both phases but in low frequencies, in chert for both Lower 5 (1.4%) and Upper 5/4E (2.4%), but in no other raw material. Platforms also mostly non-cortical (between 80% and 100% depending on raw material) in both phases.

Blank metrics, including platform measurements, show for Lower 5, the smallest means in chalcedony and dolerite, followed by chert and quartz, where greywacke mean values show bigger Flakes in this raw material. On Upper 5/4E, however, the smallest Flakes are in chert, followed by quartz and chalcedony, where dolerite mean values are fairly closer to those of greywacke, thus making these the Flakes with highest metric mean values.

Regarding elongation, quartz, chert and chalcedony show the highest values, although the latter raw material shows a bigger concentration of similar elongation flakes in the third quartil, thus showing less general elongation. Despite having similar elongation ranges in both groups, quartz shows relatively different medians, on Lower 5 showing a less variability in the lower quartil, while Upper 5/4E shows lower variability in the upper quartil, hinting at a bigger number of consistently elongated quartz flakes in Upper 5/4E. For chert, Upper 5/4E also seems to show higher elongation values for flakes, though once again, there is a wide range of variability within regarding elongation in the assemblage.

As for flattening, quartz shows very low values for flake flattening, compared to other raw materials, although the data also shows the existance of a wide variability within each raw material, with the existance of several outliers which fall from the statistical groupings and quartils. As such, it seems that for all raw materials, perhaps with the exception of quartz, flake flattening is extremely variable in the assemblage.


#### Lapa do Picareiro
There are a total of plotted 122 Flakes, 46 attributed to the U/Lower T group, more than 50% being in quartz, and 67 attributed to the Middle T group, its vast majority in chert. On both groups, attributes are very similar.

On the U/Lower T phase, for quartz, there seems to be the predominance of parallel shapes (36.8%), followed by convergent ones (26.3%). Chert, however, shows higher percentages for irregular (28.6%) and divergent (42.9%) shapes. Cross sections are mostly triangular for all raw materials (over 40%), although chert also shows high frequencies of trapezoidal cross sections (42.9%). Profiles are, for all raw materials, mostly straight (57.9% on quartz and 85.7% on chert) and terminations show relevant raw material differences, with quartz having bigger frequencies of feathered and hinged terminations (36.8% both) and chert having a frequency of 42.9% on pointed terminations. For all raw materials, there is the predominance of unidirectional dorsal patterns, high frequencies over 85%. Dorsal scars show higher frequencies for 2 and 3 scars on quartz (36.8% and 42.1% respectively), while other raw materials show higher frequencies for 3 dorsal scars only (42.9% on chert).

On the Middle T phase, quartz shows higher frequencies for irregular shapes (53.8%), followed by convergent ones (38.5%). Contrary to the patterns seen on the previous group, chert shows higher frequencies for parallel shapes (40.6%). For all raw materials, cross sections are predominantly triangular (over 40%) with straight profiles (over 50%) and feathered terminations for chert (40.6%), whereas quartz shows higher values for hinged terminations (46.2%) followed by feathered (38.5%). Alike the U/Lower T group, there is the predominance of unidirectional dorsal scar patterns (over 90% for all raw materials), with high frequencies for 2 dorsal scars in quartz (61.5%) and 2-3 dorsal scars in chert (34.4% both).

Regarding platforms, for both groups, they are mostly plain for all raw materials (over 40%), followed by relatively high values of crushed platforms in quartz, with the presence of 1 faceted platform for quartz and chert in each group. Chert on the Middle T group also shows dihedral platforms (18.8%). Platforms seem to have barely any cortex, for all raw materials in both groups.

Measurements, including platform width and thickness, show larger means for the chert flakes (19.5 mm width and 27.3 mm length), comparatively to the quartz ones (16.7 mm width and 21.8 mm length), for Lower 5 and for Upper 5/4E (chert with 17.2 mm width and 20.9 mm length, and quartz with 13 mm width and 16.3 mm length). There also seems to be a size difference between groups, with the U/Lower T flakes showing bigger means (although with high standard deviation values), while Middle T means show smaller values and smaller SD values, the only constant seeming to be the thickness of flakes on chert (5-5.3 mm), wich seem to show little variability (standard deviations of 3.1 for the U/Lower T group and 2.3 for the Middle T group).

Regarding elongation (figure X), values between quartz and chert and even between groups seem to be fairly similar, all with elongation ratios which seem skewed above, thus showing less elongation variability above the 1.5 threshold. Flake flattening, however, shows more apparent differences between raw materials, with quartz showing lower flattening ratios than chert. Within chert, however, there also seems to be a difference in general flattening variability and interquartil skewness, showing a larger number of flakes with similar flattening values (at around 4).


### Elongated blanks

#### Vale Boi
There are a total of 219 elongated products in the assemblage (fig X), 82 of them being inserted in Lower 5, while 137 are inserted in Upper 5/4E. Comparatively to blanks, there seems to be a larger number of chert pieces (n=106), this number only changing in Lower 5, where quartz elongated blank numbers (n=44) supersede chert ones (n=31).

For both phases, however, elongated blank attributes are relatively similar, following the same general patterns.

Regarding morphology, elongated blanks have mostly parallel and convergent shapes, on both phases, although Lower 5 shows wider raw material differences, where 63.6% of quartz has a parallel shapes whereas 51.6% of chert has convergent ones. Cross sections are mostly triangular, with straight profiles, although there are also high frequencies for curved profiles.

Scar patterns show an obvious tendency for unidirectional knapping strategies on all raw materials. For Lower 5, however, there is the presence of bidirectional scar direction on chert even if in low frequencies (12.9%), Upper 5/4E showing much lower values for this type of scar pattern, with 2% on quartz and 4% on chert. Scar count shows a tendency for 1 to 3 dorsal scars on both phases and all raw materials.

Elongated blanks on both phases seem to be obtained without platform preparation, since most platforms are plain, although quartz also shows crushed platforms. Only two faceted platforms were identified, in Upper 5/4E, on chert and dolerite. The general tendency for both phases is for the nonexistence of cortex on platforms, only certain raw materials showing complete cortical platforms, chert and greywacke on Lower 5 (9.7% and 16.7% respectively) and chert on Upper 5/4E (13.3%).

Finally, elongated products metrics, including platform measurements, show a tendency on both phases for smaller blanks on quartz, followed by chert, where greywacke, dolerite and chalcedony show the biggest blanks and widest platforms. On both stages, means for width, length and thickness for quartz and chert are around 9mm, 21-26mm, 5mm respectively, with higher standard deviation values for length, which is what seems to vary most in these blanks. Despite this, chert elongated blanks seem to show means which hint for higher elongation ratios than quartz.

When plotting width and length for elongated products, by raw material, there seems to be separated groups, for both phases, instead of a continuous dispersion, which may indicate separate production strategies and/or desired dimensions for products.

For Lower 5 there seems to be the existence of one single group for quartz, and two differing groups of width-length combinations for chert (Fig X), although the sample is small, possibly having an impact on the data dispersion. As such, this group in quartz might suggest the preference in Lower 5 for the production of small elongated blanks between 3-10 mm width and under 25 mm length, easily understood by the density curves. This group falls into the definition of bladelet, for the exception of a small quantity of pieces from the latter group, which, due to their width surpassing 12 mm width, are considered blades. Regarding chert, measurements are slightly more dispersed, allowing for the individualization of a wide group of smaller blanks, ranging between 2.5-12 mm width, peaking at around 10 mm, and 10-28 mm length peaking at around 20 mm, again mostly falling into the traditional definition of bladelets. The interpretation of the second group is further truncated by the small sample. The curves show not an increase in density, but instead a maintenance of the curve after a moment of drop, which might not represent a preference. Elongated products in this group have widths and lengths comprehended between 14-17 mm and 30-40 mm respectively, and can be classified as blades.

For Upper 5/4E, quartz continues to have a small sample that seems to show disperse concentrations of products, with a first group of small blanks between 2.5-6 mm width and under 20 mm length, and a second group ranging between 10-12.5 mm width and 20-30 mm length, both classified as bladelets. For quartz, there seems to be a wider dispersion without an obvious peak in the density curve, even within the two groups. For chert, there are three visible concentrations of elongated blanks, although with varying sample numbers on each group: one small group ranging between 2.5-5 mm width and 10-20 mm width, classifying as bladelets; an intermediate group and the best represented in terms of sample numbers, between 8-12.5 mm width and 15-30 mm length, classifying as bladelets with the exception of 2 pieces with slightly exceed the width bladelet limit; a group of larger blanks, with a small sample, ranging between 13-16 mm width and 30-42 mm length, traditionally classified as blades. Regarding the density curves, however, chert seems to peak between 7.5-10 mm width and 20 mm length, showing instead a unimodal curve and possibly, only one prefered width/length ratio with a wider dispersion.

#### Lapa do Picareiro
There are a total of plotted 47 elongated blanks, 27 of which belong to the U/Lower T group, more than 50% on chert, and 20 to the Middle T group, also more than 50% on chert.

Technological attributes follow closely those already described in blanks, also showing little variation between the U/Lower T and the Middle T.

Elongated blanks show a majority of parallel shapes, followed by convergent, with triangular cross sections, straight profiles followed by curved, with the exception of quartz on the Middle T group, where curved profiles are more frequent. Dorsal scars are unidirectional, with 2 negatives for quartz and 2 to 4 negatives for chert.

Platforms are mostly plain, with no cortex, where quartz seems to have the smaller dimensions.

When plotting width and length for elongated blanks, for chert and quartz, there seems to be two groups of differing dimensions. Regarding the U/Lower T, there is a group of smaller blanks, ranging between 2-10 mm of width and 5-25 mm of length, thus falling into the traditional category of bladelet, and a larger group, although much more disperse and composed mostly of chert, with widths and length ranging between 13-26 mm and 40-60 mm respectively, which may be classified as blades. The density curves for width and length on chert, however, don't seem to show the relevant existance of two groups, with only a continuous increase in values within each variables.

For the Middle T there is also a group of smaller blanks, with width ranging the 3-10 mm width, although length values vary a lot more, going between the 5-30 mm, where  the higher values are made up mostly of chert. Even so, this group may be characterized through the traditional classification of bladelet. The second group is made up entirely of chert, although it has less blanks and is very disperse in terms of width, which is higher than 15 mm, and length, higher than 45 mm, also being characterized as blades. Once again, for chert, density curves seem to show a unimodal curve.

These patterns may represent differing production strategies for specific elongated blank sizes and ratios, although, given the altitude of the site, it might simply reflect the truncated reduction sequences present at the site, thus only showing the presence of two wide groups of small elongated blanks and larger elongated blanks. without the intermediate group which wasn't transported into the site.

#### Vale Boi
As seen before, retouched pieces make up a small percentage of the assemblage, with 167 identified pieces, from which 55 can be inserted in the Lower 5 group (fig X), while 112 in the Upper 5/4E group (fig X).

Lower 5 is comprised of several typologies, from which a few stand out by their high numbers, such as retouched flakes, corresponding to 27% of total retouched pieces, mostly in chert, splintered pieces, with 25.4% of representativity, followed by notches with a frequency of 12.7%, both occurring in similar numbers in chert (n=6 and n=4 respectively) and quartz (n=8 and n=3).
There is also the presence of endscrapers (9.09%) and burins (7.27%), mostly on chert, although their frequencies in the total of retouched pieces isnât very representative.

For Upper 5/4E, splintered pieces are still very frequent (24.1%), in both chert and quartz, followed by endscrapers which represent 22.3% of the total retouched piece number, most of them in chert, although it may be relevant to point out 2 are made of dolerite. Notches are, once again, the third most frequent retouched typology, with 11.6% representativity, though most are found in quartz. Every other typology has frequencies under 10%.

Upper 5/4E thus shows not only a larger number of retouched pieces, which might be the result of a bigger occupation intensity, but also a wider variety of typologies. As Lower 5 shows 11 different retouched piece types, Upper 5/4E shows 16 types, introducing 6 new different typologies, as the double backed blade of stage 1 doesnât appear in the upper occupation.

One of these newly introduced retouched type is the Vale Comprido point, although only representing 5.3% of retouched piece total for Upper 5/4E. As mentioned before, Vale Comprido points have been identified as a Proto-Solutrean only technological solution, which may appear during the Proto-Solutrean in the Two-phase model, or during either the Terminal Gravettian or Proto-Solutrean in the Three-phase model. Thus, its presence in Upper 5/4E not only conforms to the data already presented for the Portuguese Estremadura (ZilhÃ£o 1997) it further strengths the separation of layers 4E and 5 in two moments of differing occupation.

The analysed Vale Comprido points have been identified in chert (n=1), greywacke (n=1), dolerite (n=3) and chalcedony (n=1, which makes up 100% of retouched pieces made in this raw material). In fact, dolerite had already been identified as a preferred means for making these products (Marreiros 2009), a fact only strengthened by the fact this raw material has more Vale Comprido points than any other, and only appears in one other typology, the endscraper. Comparatively, dolerite doesnât seem to be used for the production of any retouched piece in stage 1. These shall be described into further detail in Chapter 7.4.6.

#### Lapa do Picareiro
The total number of retouched pieces which have spatial information, allowing the identification of phase is 11, of which 6 belong to the U/Lower T group and 5 on the Middle T.

As seen on table X, the U/Lower T shows 4 types of retouched piece typologies, the most present being the retouched flakes (of varied elongation ratios, n=3) all in chert, where the only quartz retouched piece is a splintered piece. From the retouched flakes, one shows similarities with the Vale Comprido point, although the platform/dorsal retouched as to thin the platform is questionable. 

For the Middle T group (table x), there is a smaller variety of retouched pieces, all in chert: a notch, retouched flakes (n=2), a truncation and possibly a Vale Comprido point.

```{r retouchTG, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(retouch_table1lp, booktabs=TRUE, caption = "U/Lower T retouched piece typology by raw material.") %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T, align = "c") %>%

```

The analysis of retouched pieces at Lapa do Picareiro is, however, possibly truncated by the edge damage of the assemblage. In all levels, many pieces, both quartz and chert, although in wider quantities in the latter, show variable degrees of edge damage, from light to extensive. Although some edges were obviously damaged by, either trampling or impact by blocks, since there was no homogeneity in its distribution or directionality, some other edges show dubious marks. As such, the present study opted for a more reserved approach regarding the classification of retouch, understanding the caveats of the decision. Thus, retouched pieces, specially the retouched flakes, were only identified as such whenever they displayed homogeneous, localized and unidirectional retouch, which could not be mistaken for edge damage.

Core morphology is aimed to understand core form, reduction intensity and raw material quality and shape (Scerri et al. 2014).

The two dimensions in figure X explain 60.8% of total sample variance, where dimension 1 explains 33.1% and dimension 2 explains 27.7%. A summary of these dimensions, variables in each axis and description/interpretation may be found on table X.

Dimension 1 is represented by flatter cores with larger weight values in the positive loadings, negatively correlated to core elongation on the negative loadings. This means that bigger cores (using weight as a proxy for size) tend to be less elongated, and as the core loses its mass, shapes tend to elongate. This dimension seems to gain its statistical relevance from a group of weight driven variations, though this may be caused by a small number of high values.

Dimension 2 shows an inverse correlation between weight, on the negative loadings (although seemingly not very pronounced) with core elongation, convergence and flattening, that, on the positive loadings, seem to correlate positively. This might represent the reduction of total core volume and subsequential core shapping (Scerri et al. 2014).

Regarding phases, the assemblage from Upper 5/4E seems concentrated on the negative loadings of dimension 2, which might represent the assemblage is driven by morphological changes, between cores that are more elongated, convergent and flatter and some that are less elongated (Scerri et al. 2014). Despite this, core morphology variation between groups seems similar, although Lower 5 does show more weight driven variation than Upper 5/4E.

The two dimensions from core morphology in quartz (CMQ) explain 62.3% of sample variance.

Dimension 1, representing 32.9% of variance, shows on the positive loadings flatter and more convergent values, inversely correlated with core elongation, meaning that as cores become flatter and with higher values of convergence, they become less elongated.

Dimension 2, explaining 29.4% of variance, is dominated by the inverse correlation between weight (on the negative loadings) with core elongations, convergence and flattening (on the positive loadings), once again repeating the pattern already observed on chert, and which might represent the reduction of core volume through knapping.

Lower 5 is mostly represented on the positive loadings of dimension 2, meaning it is dominated by high scores in core elongation, convergence and flattening, while Upper 5/4E seems to be mostly located on the negative loadings. This might mean that cores in Lower 5 might be more elongated and smaller, with a variation better explained by morphology, whereas core variation from Upper 5/4E might be better explained by changes in mass than changes in convergence or flattening, although there seems to be some tendency for elongated cores in Upper 5/4E as well.

Core use domain aims to understand how knappers reduced cores using different techniques to shape them (Scerri et al. 2014). The first two components in the chert core use analysis explain a cumulative percentage of 53.5% of the assemblage's variability.

Dimension one (table X) explains 29.9% of the sample's variability. On the positive loadings there are the variables Core to length ratio, main face scar length, weight and mainface scar platform, negatively correlated to core convergence. This may represent that heavier cores are less convergent, with longer scars and bigger angle values. Using weight as a proxy for size, this may show that, as there is more reduction, and the cores become smaller, they also become more convergent, although blank length might become smaller as the angles reduce as well.

There seems to be some difference in phase dispersion. While Lower 5 individuals point towards less convergent cores, varying in weight, Upper 5/4E individuals shows highter values for convergence, also with some size variation.

Dimension 2 explains 23.6% of sample variability. Positive loadings show that, as overall variables increase, weight and main face platform angle decreases, which may be understood by core mass reduction through shaping (making them more or less convergent), which in turn creates smaller platform angles. In this dimension, Upper 5/4E shows a dispersed number of individuals in the negative loadings, hinting for a wider number of size driven individuals, although the biggest difference between phases seems to happen in regards to convergence and scar length/scar to core length ratio.

For quartz, the two dimensions in core use explain a cumulative 62% of variability, with dimension 1 representing 40.6% and dimension 2 representing 21.4% (table X), and thus, considerably less.

Dimension 1 shows a positive correlation between all variables, although with different representations. Core convergence, scar to core length ratio, main face platform angles and scar length all show high values in the positive loadings of Dim 1, which means there is an association between convergent cores and longer blanks.These values, however, might be influenced the the high percentage of represention a few invididuals seem to have, located on the further negative loadings of Dim 1, which are less convergent, with smaller and shorter scars. Despite those values, most individuals for both phases seem to be equaly located on the positive loadings or fairly close.

As for dimension 2, it shows a negative correlation between core convergence and scar convergence with weight, meaning that as weight reduces, cores become more convergent accompanied by more convergent scars as well, although these become smaller. Once again, this might represent core mass reduction through the shapping of the core. Upper 5/4E is better represented on the negative loadings of this dimension, showing a bigger quantity of heavier and less convergent individuals than Lower 5.

The platform maintenance (BP) domain aims to explore how knappers controlled platform dimensions or used platform faceting to control flake length (Scerri et al 2014). On chert, the two dimensions of platform maintenance (BPC) explain 43.2% of the samples variability. The decrease on cumulative percentages comparatively to cores might be explained by either the internal higher variability of flakes or the increase sample size.

Dimension 1 explains 25.9% of variance. Low elongation is correlated positively with high platform flattening, on the positive loadings, while high elongation is correlated with low flattening. This might indicate similar sized blanks might he controlled by how deep the knapper strikes into the platform (Scerri et al. 2014).  This dimension also shows the association of other types of platform preparation, winged and dihedral platforms with low elongation values, while plain platforms seem mostly associated with high elongation, although showing less contribution than other variables.

Dimension 2, which explains 17.3% of sample variance, show an association of medium elongation with crushed platforms, which may reflect atypical flakes, with unprepared production compared to either low elongation (which should represent flakes) and high elongation blanks. Comparatively, high and low elongation values show association with other types of platforms, which included faceted platforms.

For both dimensions, neither Lower 5 or 2 show particular differences, both showing equal internal variability regarding the variables chosen for the MCA.

Regarding platform maintenance on quartz (BPQ), the two main dimensions explain 54.4% of the sample.

Dimension 1, which explains 31% of variability, shows the association between high elongation scores and low flattening, although for quartz, other types of platforms seem to correlate positively as well. Low elongation is correlated with high platform flattening values, however, and with plain platforms although, once again, this variable seems to contribute less than others. These patterns may represent differences in platform preparation and platform striking to control blank shape between raw materials.

Dimension 2, representing 23.4% of variability, shows medium elongation values on the negative area, where high and low elongation are found on the positive axis, as well as other types of platform. This may reflect an intermediate blank with no particular preparation, while high elongation blanks are more often achieved with resource to specific platform types.

Alike on chert, Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E donât show significant differences between each other, both represented at the centre of the MCA.

Dorsal surface convexity (BD) on chert shows a cumulative percentage of 39.8% for both principal dimensions, with dimension 1 representing 28.1% of sample variance, and dimension 2 representing 11.7%, much lower frequencies than the first.

Dimension 1 shows an association between high elongation, low vertical convexity, convergent and parallel shapes, triangular and trapezoidal cross sections and straight profiles. This may signify control of elongation through morphological characteristics or represent a reduction sequence for elongated blanks with preferential blank characteristics, as opposed to the negative loadings in this dimensions, which show low elongations correlated with irregular morphological attributes or other shapes.

Dimension 2, which as seen, explains much less variability, differentiates between two groups: a group with irregular attributes and a group with other attributes such as lenticular cross sections or âotherâ blank shapes, showing that there is a group of blanks, correlated with low elongation, which shows much more irregular characteristics than the other two identified blank groups.

There seems to exist a difference between phases, where Upper 5/4E is relatively centered, though pulling towards the negative dimension 1 axis, and thus towards the high elongation, convergent/parallel with triangular cross section blanks, and Lower 5 is further into the positive axis. This slight difference between phases might represent a difference in blank production between Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E, which might be understood as the result of the presence of Vale Comprido points in Upper 5/4E, which are represented by a specific type of elongated blanks with convergent shapes, absent from Lower 5.

The two main dimensions in the dorsal surface convexity domain on quartz (BDQ) have explain 35.6% of the assemblageâs variability.
Dimension 1, which explains 23.6%, shows the association of high elongation, parallel shapes, triangular cross sections and low vertical convexities, in opposition to low elongation, more irregular blanks or with other attributes such as âotherâ blank shapes, high vertical convexities and lenticular cross sections.

Dimension 2 explains only 12% of variability, opposing, alike chert, a group of irregular blanks with the other group of âotherâ blank shapes, lenticular cross sections, high vertical convexities and low elongations. 

Once again, the association of these particular groups may show three similar types of products, with high elongation products having the same preferential attributes, although, on quartz, the difference between phases isnât as obvious as with chert.
Accepting the combination of elongated blanks with convergent shapes a by-product of Vale Comprido operative sequences, the lack of relevance of that shape on this MCA and the lack of differentiation between phases might be result of the inexistence of these types of retouched products in quartz.

Core exploitation (CE) aims to understand the way knappers rotated cores, in order to create different dorsal surface convexity patterns (Scerri et al. 2014). The two main dimensions in chert (CEC) show a cumulative percentage of 51.5%, explaining half of the sampleâs variability. 

Dimension 1, which explains 37.8% of variability, shows the correlation between more than 60% cortex, no scars and other scar patterns (which most likely are mostly comprised by the variable ânoneâ). These represent early stages of blank removal, with cortical blanks or very high indexes of cortex, thus showing no scars and no patterns. In opposition to this group, there is on the negative axis of dim 1 other more variable reduction stages or strategies, generally characterized by low percentages of cortex.

Dimension 2, which explains much less variability (13.7%), shows two different stages or strategies within the reduction sequence: correlation on the positive axis of dim 2 of bidirectional patterns on blanks with 3 to 4 or more dorsal scars, related with high elongation blanks;  correlation on the negative axis of dim 2 between low elongation blanks, with 1 or 2 dorsal scars and unidirectional dorsal patterns. The understanding of dim 2 is however truncated since both groups lack obvious individualization, with only a couple variables standing out with stronger correlations, such as bidirectional patterns with 4 or more dorsal scars, and presence of 1 dorsal scar with low elongation blanks.

Once again, there are no obvious differences between the phases, for either dimension.

On quartz (CEQ), the two main dimensions explain a cumulative percentage of 49.5%, where dimensions 1 explains 33.6%, and once again, dimension 2 explains a much smaller percentage (15.9%).

Dimension 1 shows the association of more than 60% cortex, âotherâ scar patterns (mostly comprised of variable ânoneâ) and âotherâ scar count (comprised mostly of â0â values), representing, alike chert, an early moment of core reduction, in opposition to the other more advanced reduction stages.

Dimension 2 seems to differentiate as well two groups of differing reduction strategies, alike chert. There is the correction between high elongation with dorsal scar counts of 2 and 3, on the negative axis, while on the positive there is the association between 31-60%  and 1-30% cortex, dorsal scar counts of 1 and low elongations. This may represent an early stage of core reduction as well, where less elongated blanks still have cortex and have less scars, in comparison to a later stage of reduction, where the desired elongated products have more scars and much less cortex.

Regarding phases, both Lower 5 and Upper 5/4E seem very alike on quartz, almost completely overlapping at the centre of both dimensions axis.

Since PCAs and MCAs on the domains shown on table X were applied to all blanks, which included the elongated blanks as well, instead of running them again on this particular sample, severely limiting the numbers and variability, instead some variables with impact on morphology were chosen, in order to understand morphological and technological patterns on elongated blanks. As such, the domain elongated blanks attributes (EA) was applied for chert (EAC) and quartz (EAQ) individually. For EA, two qualitative supplementary variables were considered: phase, as previous PCAs and MCAs; elongated blank type (bladelet and blade), in order to understand possible morphological preferences for each type, which might help understand whether there is the existence of two separate production strategies, or a continuous reduction of cores and thus blank size.

The two main dimensions of EAC explain 39% of the sample variability, dimension 1 explaining 20.2% and dimension 2 explaining 18.8%.
Dimension 1 shows a strong association between an earlier moment of reduction, with no dorsal scar patterns and 0 scars, differing from the rest of the products which belong to a later stage of reduction. This may be interpreted as the existence of dedicated elongated blank production strategies, which start with already elongated entirely cortical products.

Dimension 2 shows the association between pointed terminations, convergent shapes, straight profiles, unidirectional patterns and 1 to 2 dorsal scars on the negative axis, and the correlation between curved profiles, parallel shapes, 4 or more dorsal scars, steps and degÃ¨te terminations and bidirectional patterns.

Regarding the supplementary loadings, there seems to be some similarity between Lower 5 and 2, although the biggest differences occur within the elongated blank type. While bladelets fall further into the negative axis of dim 2, closer to the unidirectional, convergent and pointed blanks, blades fall onto the positive axis of dim 2, showing more correlation to curved profiles and more variability in terms of attributes and dorsal scar counts, which may indicate that smaller products have more standardized attributes than larger elongated blanks.

For quartz, the two main dimensions of EAQ explain 39.7% of the sampleâs variability.

Dimension 1, which explains 23%, shows a strong association between bidirectional scar patterns and 4 or more dorsal scar counts, a strong correlation which has already been established on previous MCAs. Once again, the other group seems to show the correlation between the rest of the attributes. What these associations show, however, is also the inexistence of a strongly correlated early stage of reduction specifically for elongated blanks in quartz.

Dimension 2, representing 16.7% of variability,  shows the association between curved profiles, convergent shapes, pointed terminations with 3 dorsal scars on the positive axis, while the negative axis, although contributing less, shows the association between parallel shapes, 1 to 2 dorsal scars, straight profiles, feathered terminations, both axis seemingly sharing the unidirectionality of dorsal scar patterns.

Unlike chert, there is no great difference between Lower 5 and 2, neither between bladelets and blades, hinting to perhaps a continuous production strategy for both large and small elongated blanks, instead of two different sequences for the obtention of blades and bladelets.

Following the methodologies already described, the blank attributes were divided into domains (table x), separated by chert and quartz, the most present raw materials, which were analysis by MCAs. Cores were not, however, due to the low sample, and thus, low existing variability.

Blank platform maintenance (BP) shows two dimensions which explain 52% of the total assemblageâs variability.

Dimension 1, which explains 27.5%, shows a correlation between high elongation with high platform flattening values, crushed and other types of platforms. On the negative axis, low platform flattening values are associated with dihedral platforms and medium elongation, which might indicate that blanks might have been controlled by platform depth and preparation, although plain platforms are recurring in all elongation ratios.

Dimension 2, explaining 24.5% of variability, shows on the negative axis, high elongation values associated with low flattening, plain and crushed platforms, while the positive axis is represented by low elongation with high platform flattening values, dihedral and other platforms, which once again seems to show blank elongation through platform depth, perhaps more than platform type.

The supplementary variables show some differences, where the U/Lower T group seems further pulled into the high elongation and high flattening log, which might represent a knapping strategy most present in this group, while the Middle T is closer to the centre, and thus seemingly much more variable.

Regarding platform maintenance in quartz, the two main dimensions explain 71.2% of the sampleâs variability, Dim 1 explaining 48.2% and Dim 2 explaining considerably less (23%). These high values might be related to either assemblage size, since the samples for Lapa do Picareiro are much smaller than those for Vale Boi, or simply by internal assemblage variability, since Lapa do Picareiro doesnât seem to have the presence in situ of a complete reduction sequence.

Dimension 1, on the positive axis, has the association between low elongation and low platform flattening values, associated with plain platforms and other platforms. On the negative axis there is high elongation values with high flattening and crushed platforms, which, once again, might represent the control of blank elongation by how deep into the platform the knapper hits.

Dimension 2 shows on the negative axis the correlation between high and low elongations and plain platforms, while on the positive axis there are medium elongations and other platforms, crushed platforms and low platform flattening values. This axis might represent probable differences between high and low elongations mostly represented by plain platforms, from intermediate elongation products.

Similarly to chert, the supplementary variables seem to show some differences between the two groups, where the Middle T seems closer to the medium elongation products while the Terminal Gravettin gravitates close to the centre of both dimensions.

The two dimensions of dorsal surface convexity in chert (BDC) show a cumulative percentage of 45.2%, explaining almost half of the sampleâs variability.

Dimension 1, which explains 27.7%, shows the correlation on the positive axis between low elongation and high vertical convexity with attributes which are represented less than 0.05%, such is the case for other blank shapes, other cross sections, but also irregular blank shapes. On the negative axis, there is the correlation between high elongation, medium and low vertical convexity values, as well as several attributes such as parallel and convergent blank shapes, triangular and trapezoidal cross sections, and other types of profile. This might represent a higher frequency of standardization for elongated blanks, with parallel shapes and triangular/trapezoidal cross sections.

Dimension 2, explaining 17.5% of variability,  shows once again low and high elongations opposed to medium elongations, the latter associated with divergent blank shapes, low vertical convexity values, curved profiles and convergent blank shapes. This might represent different strategies to control elongation based on the morphology of dorsal convexity, although this domain seems better explained by dimension 1.

Once again, there seems to be a difference between the U/Lower T and Middle T groups, which appear in opposing axis. While U/Lower T shows more proximity towards the high elongation, parallel and triangular cross section correlations, the Middle T group seems closer to the low elongation group, a pattern already established in the previous domain.

```

Regarding the dorsal convexity in quartz, the two main dimensions explain a cumulative percentage of 45%, where Dim 1 explains 28.6% and Dim 2 explains a much small percentage (16.4%).

Dimension 1 shows the association between irregular blank attributes, low vertical convexities and other cross sections, low elongations and convergent blank shapes, on the positive axis, and high elongation with parallel shapes, high vertical convexities, trapezoidal, triangular and lenticular cross sections and curved profiles on the negative. This dimension may represent the existence of a higher standardization of more elongated blanks, where lower elongation blanks often show more irregular or varying attributes.

Dimension 2 shows the correlation between medium elongation blanks with low convexities, trapezoidal cross sections, straight profiles, and a wider variability of attributes on the negative axis, while high and low elongations are still on the opposed axis like on chert, although this dimensions explain much less the dimension 1.

Supplementary variables also seem to follow the patterns shown on chert, where the Middle T group shows a tendency closer to the less elongated blanks, while the U/Lower T group shows a slight tendency for more elongated blanks, the two groups again showing some differences in terms of technology.

Core exploitation on chert (CEC) explains, with its two main dimensions, 52.8% of the sampleâs variability.

Dimension 1, which explains 30.6%, shows the association between low elongation and 1 scar count, on the positive axis, and high and medium elongations related to 3 to 4 or more scars and low percentages of cortex presence. These associations seem to show the lack of an initial stage of reduction strategies, showing only the following less cortical stages.

Dimension 2, explaining 22.2% of variability, shows a correlation between 2 scars with high elongation and unidirectional dorsal patterns on the negative axis, and 3 to 4 or more scars with use of other types of dorsal patterns. This shows the use of simple unidirectional strategies with less dorsal patterns, and other patterns with more dorsal patterns, which might reflect either different strategies or moments in the reduction sequence.

Differences between the U/Lower T and Middle T groups are more obvious in the dimension 1, once again reflecting differences in the elongations, with Middle T having lower elongation values comparatively to U/Lower T groups, although differences in dimension 2 are barely inexistent.

The two dimensions in core exploitation in quartz (CEQ) explain 56.9% of the assemblageâs variability, with dimension 1 representing 34.4% and dimension 2 explaining 22.5%.

Dimension 1 shows the association between low elongation, cortex percentages higher than 30%, 1 scar count, other scar pattern and other scar count, on the positive axis, while on the negative axis are concentrated other more variable attributes, related to high elongations. This dimension might represent moments of early reduction (although without fully cortical pieces) and moments further into the reduction sequence, and with more scars and other patterns, in opposition to a more standardized group with less scars.

Dimension 2 shows exactly the difference between the already referred groups: one with 1 scar count and more than 60% cortex, and another with other scar patterns and scar counts, possibly representing the difference between an initial stage of reduction (though not entirely cortical) and a more advanced and complex stage with a higher scar count. These three obviously separated groups might reflect the truncated reduction sequence present at Lapa do Picareiro.

The same pattern of supplementary variables as seen previously seems to repeat itself on the CEQ domain.

Using the same methodology as applied for chert, the domains used for blanks were condensed into one single analysis, in order to understand morphological and technological patterns in elongated blanks, while adding as supplementary variables groups and types of elongated products.

The two dimensions in elongated attributes for chert (EAC) explain 47.1% of the sample variability.

Dimension 1, which explains 27.4%,  shows on the positive axis, the association between hinged and step terminations, irregular profiles and 4 or more dorsal scars, while opposed on the negative axis by blanks with convergent shapes, curved profiles and pointed terminations, with 3 to 2 scars even if with less contribution. This may represent the existence of a group of more standardized elongated blanks, as opposed to a group of less standardized ones.
On dimension 2, explaining 19.7% of variability, there is the association of twisted and straight profiles, parallel blank shapes, step and feathered terminations, with 2 scar counts, on the negative axis. The positive axis of Dim 2 shows the correlation between the groups mentioned on dimension 1, possibly showing the existence of 3 groups of similar elongated blanks, each with specific characteristics.

Regarding the supplementary variables, there seems to be significant differences between both the U/Lower T and Middle T groups, and bladelet/blade groups. The differences between U/Lower T and Middle T seem to happen mostly on Dim 1, where the Middle T group seems closer to the group of blanks with convergent shapes, pointed terminations and curved profiles than the U/Lower T. As for the other supplementary variables, there seems to be a wide gap between them, with blades being far closer to the 4 or more scars group, while the bladelet positions itself closer to the negative axis of both dimension 1 and 2. This may mean that blades show more scars than bladelets, possibly with other morphological characteristics, while bladelets show less scars and score closer to the group of convergent, pointed and curved blanks and 2 scars, parallel, feathered and straight group.

For elongated attributes on quartz (EAQ), the two main dimensions explain a cumulative 64.7%, a high value probably result of the small sample.

Dimension 1, which explains most of this variability (40.7%) shows the correlation on the positive axis of pointed terminations, convergent shapes and curved profiles, other blank shapes, hinged terminations and 3 dorsal scars. On the negative axis, there is the association between step and feather terminations, parallel shapes and straight profiles, with 1 to 2 dorsal scars.
Dimension 2, explaining much less of the variability (24%) differentiates between a group of blanks with pointed terminations, curved profiles and convergent shapes with 2 dorsal scars, and a group with 3 dorsal scars, hinged terminations, straight profiles and other blank shapes.

These two dimensions seem to, alike chert, create 3 groups of more or less standardized attributes, although the strong association between 3 dorsal scars and hinged termination, as well as with the supplementary variable blade, are probably the result of the small sample.

As such, bladelets are localized right at the centre of both dimensions, since they represent most of the sample. Regarding the other supplementary variables, the U/Lower T group seems closer to the step and feathered terminations, with parallel shapes and straight profiles, with 1 to 2 scars, while the Middle T group is further closer to the group of pointed termination, curved profile and convergent bladelets, which might represent a standardized preference for small elongated blank morphologies in quartz.
